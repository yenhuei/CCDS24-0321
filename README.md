# Hello! Welcome to my FYP project CCDS24-0321:DRL-Powered Resource Coordination for UAV-THz Computation Offloading.

Do note that there are some minor setting up needed to be able to run the experiment. Please follow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52727233/how-can-i-register-a-custom-environment-in-openais-gym or any other forums detailing how to register a custom gym environment. Subsequently you may copy the EnvironmentGen.py code over to the classic-control folder. Then the simulation codes DDQN.py, DQN.py, Random Offloading.py should be able to work.

There are some differences from the code used here compared to the ones in the Appendix as those have been truncated for better readability. The simulation codes are cluttered with many variables used for collecting statistics to be used with TensorBoard. 

#Thank you for visiting!
